* code writing
accept input from keyboard, iterate through array

* java vs javac
will be a question

* know multi-dimensional arrays

* anatomy of program
statements < blocks < methods < class
all 3, statements & blocks & methods go in class
*components of java class*

* comments
//
/*
*/

* reserved words
cannot be used in identifiers

* escape sequences
for use in print statements
\t - tab
\r ? - don't need to know r
\n - new line
\" - double quote
\\ - backslash

* variable names
A-z
0-9 /cannot start with a digit/ -> probably test question
_ -> underscore
$  -> $ sign

* know println, printf, print
println -> new line
print -> ouput stream
printf -> floating point, decimal digits
%f", variable ^^^^^^^
%d
%s

* Scanner
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); *do not forgot to put System.in*

* declare and intialize variables
putting int into double

 

* primitive data types
all are primitive except for String


* operators
()
!
*
/
%
+
-
know precedence, how to use all of them

* String
know String.equals("Yes")
NEVER use ==

String name = new String ("Yes");
OR
String name = "Yes";

* logical operators
&&
||
!

* if/else/else if
know syntax, how to write it

* question 4 on review
int sum=0;
for(int i = 1; i<200;i++)
      if(i%3==0)
      {
        sum=sum+i;
      }

* maybe advantages of C++ over JAva will be on test
but for Java > C++
run once, run anywhere
pointers and shit

* #10 on review
String.replace method -> know String methods!!!
do concat for all 10 strings
then String.replace("e", "i");
