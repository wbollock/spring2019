system.out.println;
(some action)
** blocks

** classes
every .java file has at least 1 class
one .java file can have multiple classes in it. however, only *one of the classes can be public*
*** name of the one public class must match the .java name
** methods
a function that belongs to a class
* Main function - can put in command line arguments
for example, java HelloWorld WillBollock
WillBollock will be passed through as an argument, and the program can do something with it
**  Identifier

basically a name of ANYTHING
*** rules
cannot be a java keyword/reserved word
can have $, _, 1231, and words
CANNOT start with a 123124 number
*** style
CamelCase is good for classes, interfaces, methods
but lowerCamelCase is good for variables, and also methods
AVOID using $
