creates objects that store flexible strings
** String class
part of java.lang package
*** fixed object
a string class cannot be changed
** Constructing a string
1. Instansitate like an object

String example = new String("Hello, World!");

** String pool (note the difference)

String str1 = "Hello";

** substring
extracts part of a string and returns in
takes the starting index and ending index

String s1 = "Hello, World";
String s2 =
