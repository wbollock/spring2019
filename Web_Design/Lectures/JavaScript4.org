* addEventListener
can do window.addEventListener( "load", start, false ); to start the function upon page load
good for when waiting for someone to do something

*  HTML 5 audio element
used to embed audio into a web page

** preload
auto is a good attribute for this. tells browser to download the audio clip so it's ready whenever the game needs it

** formats
type = "audio/mpeg"
type = "audio/ogg"

* HTML5 video elements
i literally dont know what to say

* Scope

** global variables
don't use them

** local identifiers  
those within a function are local

* global functions
there's an object called /global/
this function has some vars and functions

** examples
isFinite
isNaN
parsefloat
don't need to call object before, just do isFinite();

* Recursion
a recursive function calls /itself/
recursive function can only solve the *base case*
example being /factorial function/

* Iteration
iteration will use a repetition statement
gradually approaches termination
** iteration vs recursion
recursion doesn't necessarily use a repetition statement, because it just calls itself instead
recursion keeps going until base case is reached

* JAVASCRIPT ARRAYS

* Arrays
data structures consisting of related items
in JS, they're dynamic and can change size after they are created
start at 0

** .length
every array in java know it's own length
can use array.length() to find length

** reallocation
JS will automtaically reallocate the array when a value is an assigned to an "out of bounds" element

** initializing array
var n1 = new Array( 5 ); // array of size 5
var n2 = new Array(); // empty array

** intailizier list
var n = [ 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ];

var undefined = [ 2, , , 8];
those two empty elements will both be /undefined/

* for in
similar to enhanced for loop? / python

for ( var element in theArray ) /element can be anything/
{
 // add values
}

will only select elements that are defined, *skips undefined elements in the array*
