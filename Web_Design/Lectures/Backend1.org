* Starting with Project Info

* Animated Progress Bar
/meter/ is a bad way to indicate progress completion of a form
1. on button click, start setInterval
2. setInterval does the function frame every 10 ms
3. in frame, if width=100%, then stop/remove timer with clearInterval
4. if not, add 1% to width of progres bar. 
Remember that it calls this every 10ms, so it adds 1% width every 10 ms

** global vars
we need global vars to do this because it's across functions
width would reset every time if not

* JS validation

* TODO for test
know "true tables"
OR
AND
&&
idk

* backend

* key=value
key value pairs
?source=hp&q=javascript
source /is the key/
hp /hp is the value/

* get method
can be bookmarked/saved, not secure, remains in browser history
just for requesting data, not modifying it

* post method
used to send data to a server
/URL DOES NOT CONTAIN THE QUERY OR DATA/
different than get method

* HTTP response
1 of 2 things
1. browser puts new html code in the page (chat room)
2. brwoser sends you two different web page (login page)
** header
information for the browser
** payload
data displayed to the user
HTML code, JSON data, etc
** browser takes action
uses header and payload to render new web page

* Express
* Node.js
JS runtime framework - can use JS outside of a browser
** npm
package manager
** Express
expres.js is a web framework for node.js
** GET HANDLER
1. resource
2. middleware function
*** resource
"/"
is the root of the website, www.google.com means www.google.com/
our case, it is the current directory
*** middleware function
function (req, res)
req - request the handler recievies
res - response the handler sends out
