* RECALL: The DOM
everything is an object
remember tree of nodes
* Finding HTML elements
recall querySelectorAll returns an array[]
* Changing HTML
innerHTML -> literally change the code of an element
* Changing CSS
element.*style*.property -> 
you used this a bunch 
element.style.fontSize = 2 + px;
* adding html elements
document.createElement(element);
document.createTextNode(some text);
parentElement.appendChild(childElement);
* 
* 
* 
* 
* Javascript Types
Reminder that JS variables do not have types, but the values do
boolean
number
string
symbol
null
undefined
* TODO REVIEW WHAT METHODS GO WITH WHAT OBJECTS
example: what does "Math" have on it?
What types go with what objects
Might be good for String and Math classes/objects. Will be good on cheat sheet
ex: know what split (string) does in String object methods
** char
know charAt and charCodeAt (Unicode version of charAt)
some char methods like fromCharCode, toUpperCase, etc
* split and substring
totally missed them
* Date Object
date and time manipulations
** TODO pay attenton to the damn Date Object methods
may want all of those on the cheat sheat
note that stuff like getTime() returns milliseconds because 1970 and now
** months
are set from 0-11
NOT
1-12
0 = January
1 != January
off-by-one error
* Boolean and Number Objects
wrap an object around boolean values
** boolean pobject
var b = new Boolean( booleanValue );
lets you do more things with Boolean objects
reminder that false, 0, nul, number.Nan, are all boolean stuff
** boolean methods
toString() and valueOf()
* 
* 
* 
* JSON
* Javascript Object Notation
represents JS objects as Strings
kind of like XML for data-exchange
format:
{ propertyName1: value1, propertyName2: value2}
** arrays in json
[value0,value1,value2]
these values can also be strings, numbers, true/false/null, JSON objects
** representing objects
JSON lets you represent and manipulate objects. also can extract things from Internet and transmit them

* DOM 
ALL html5 elements can be treated as objects
