* js files
we can put JS inline, but it'll be better to do it externally

* document object
represents HTML5 document currently being displayd in browser

* window object
uses method /alert/ to display the little dialog box
also has the method /prompt/, lets user put in value

* null & undefined 

** null
no value

** undefined
value given to a variable that has not been given a value

* adding integers

** parseInt
converts strings to an integer
number1 = parseInt( firstNumber );

* Memory

** variable
replaces the previous value in a memory location
then when it's read, is nondestructive?

* Loosely Typed Language - JS
do NOT have to declare what type the variable is

* TODO undefined vs null -> she keeps stressing that

* Arthimetic Operators
% mod operator
13 % 7 -> result is 6

** equality stuff
we went through precedence/order
and equality and relational operators
